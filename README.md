# Group Feedback Tracker

A simple React application I build to keep track of groups in a classroom when
joining breakout rooms to keep track of which groups I have visited during a
feedback session or lecture. Built with React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

As a teacher holding remote lectures I often find myself visiting breakout rooms
where students are working with assignements on a non structured basis. When
having more than 8 gruops I find it hart to keep track of which groups I have
visited and not, and made this simple application to track this during a
session.

Feel free to fork, clone and modify this application as suits your needs! Enjoy!
